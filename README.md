## Getting Setup

I am using several dummy dataset from Kaggle.

Please feel free to upload your own dataset! The AI agent can handle them as well.

You will then need to install the requirements by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and run the streamlit dashboard by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run data_analysis_streamlit_app.py --server.maxUploadSize 2000
```

To use this app, please first create your own OpenAI API key and paste it in a .env file.

Enjoy!
